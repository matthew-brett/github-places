UN list of countries
--------------------

The file `un_stats_division_countries.csv` contains information about country
codes and classification. It is a very slightly modified copy of a file
downloaded in March 2019 from the [UN statistics
website](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview).  The
modifications are three single-character edits to replace commas in country
names with semi-colons. It's not clear what the license is, but I will assume, until
someone tells me otherwise, that the data are public domain, and can be
distributed freely.

`state_table.csv` is a download via <https://statetable.com> with thanks.  Here's a quote from the site:

> I make no guarantees this site or its data are accurate. I'll do my best, but
